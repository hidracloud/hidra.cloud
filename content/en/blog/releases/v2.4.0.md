In this release we added 947 lines of code, and remove 496 lines of code. We added a ton of new features that we hope will be useful to you.

## New features

- Hidra has a new scenario type called security. This type is used to describe security related scenarios.
  - Scan opened ports of a host and report the results.
  - Scan opened ports of a cidr and report the results.

## Release improvements

- Hidra release now contains a *.deb package for Debian based OS.

## Performance improvements

- We change the way we ran scenarios on exporter mode. We now run the scenarios in parallel, and we use a pool of workers to run the scenarios. Now you can run scenarios faster than ever.
- We improved the way we generate screenshots. We now generate screenshots in an independent thread, and we use a pool of workers to generate the screenshots.
- Now, we're randomizing the order of the scenarios. This will help us to run scenarios faster. This will avoid to run similar scenarios in the same order.

## Other improvements

- We pass context between all functions. This will help us to add new features in the future. (Who love opentelemetry?)
- We added a lot of new tests to make sure that Hidra is working as expected, and we keep code clean.
