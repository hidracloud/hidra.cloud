If you want to monitor your services from different locations, constantly and want to store the results in a database, you will need to generate a Hidra-api. Hidra-API is the first component you will need to be able to monitor your services 24/7.

Hidra API will allow you to store pipelines in a database, visualise metrics, connect agents, tag agents and launch tests from as many places as you want.

# Getting started
At the moment, Hidra only supports SQLite databases, support for other databases will come in the next release, currently, Hidra-API and Hidra-Agent are proof of concepts.

To start working with the Hidra API, simply run hidra with the `-api` argument, i.e:

    hidra -api

When you start Hidra for the first time, you will receive a root password. Store it, you will need it to perform operations.
