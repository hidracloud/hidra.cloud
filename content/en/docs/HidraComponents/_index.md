description: Here you can configure all Hidra components
---

Hidra has 4 main components, each component has a functionality and a use.

To summarise, each component has the following function:
- **Test 🧪**: Allows you to run pipelines from the command line.
- **API 🌐**: Allows you to deploy an API where agents communicate to download the pipelines and send the results.
- **Agent 👨‍✈️**: Connects to the API to download and execute the pipelines, and send you the results.
- **Metric 👀**: Connects to database and generates metrics.

You can run at the same time all 4 components, or you can run only one of them. Using flags, you can configure the components you want to run.
