description: Here you can configure all Hidra components
---

Hidra has 4 main components, each component has a functionality and a use.

To summarise, each component has the following function:
- **Test 🧪**: Allows you to run pipelines from the command line.
- **Exporter 🌐**: Allows you to an Hidra exporter that will generate metrics and expose them through Prometheus.

You can run at the same time all 4 components, or you can run only one of them. Using flags, you can configure the components you want to run.
